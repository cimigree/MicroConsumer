# Topical Tweet Viewer

This is a web app that allows the user to choose from one of three topics to view the latest ten Tweets in English that were Tweeted.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In case you don’t already have the following, you will need to have them installed.

```
1. Install [Node 4.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org/) - (5.0 or greater is recommended for optimal build performance). Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Install Yarn. 
On a Mac:
You can install Yarn through the [Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh/). This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

brew install yarn

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) you should exclude installing Node.js so that nvm’s version of Node.js is used.

brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies
```

### Installing

To get this app up and running in a development environment:


```
1. Fork the repo: and then run git clone to use it locally.
```

2. Run yarn install or npm install to install the dependencies.

```
3. Type yarn start into the console to start up a development server at localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

To deploy, simply type yarn build into the terminal and then you will find your built documents in the dist folder. Create a folder called public in the dist folder. Move all files but the index.html into the public folder and then you are good to publish to any static website generator.
